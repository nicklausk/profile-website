        	<p>I am currently a doctoral graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin in Biomedical Engineering. I am a member of the Biomedical Informatics Lab run by principal investigator, Dr. Mia K. Markey, as well as a graduate student trainee at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center under Dr. Gregory Reece. I received my BSE from Case Western Reserve University. My primary research is using engineering principles to design better decision-making tools and information delivery for those considering undergoing breast reconstruction after breast cancer. Many patients have to make decisions about their breast reconstruction care without having realistic expectations of how they will look like after the procedures. I use computer-learning tools to help reconstructive surgeons provide personalized care and communicate with their patients. I have also contributed to research involving using augmented reality visualizations to improve reconstruction surgery as well as designing better post-breast surgery bras. </p>
