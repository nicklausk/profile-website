<b> <font size= "+0.3">Teaching Assistant: </font></b> I was a teaching assistant for three semesters for the Engineering Communications course at UT Austin, designing my own activities for three discussion sections per week. My focus for this course was emphasizing that engineers have to be good communicators and framing the writing process as similar to the engineering cycle to promote good writing practice. I appreciated this quote from a student in the course instructor survey, </p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Krista always answered my questions in a respectful manner, and took the time to make sure I understood what she was saying. Her comments on my essays and papers really helped me to improve my writing style. She was always clearly explained what she was looking for in our writing. Because of her, I became a better writer.”</i> </p></blockquote>

<b> <font size="+0.3">Graduate Certificate in Engineering Education: </font></b> I will complete the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Education in May 2020. The certificate encompasses a series of courses, a teaching practicum, and a teaching portfolio. For my teaching practicum, I was a student-teacher for the course Computational Fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering Design, mentored by Dr. Dan Puperi. I developed lecture and active learning materials for three lecture classes in the Active Filters and Biomedical Informatics units and a laboratory mini-lesson. The teaching practicum is a valuable experience for graduate students or post-docs, as I received structured feedback and mentoring about my teaching materials and delivery in a lecture setting. We wrote an academic paper analyzing the teaching practicum experience from multiple stakeholder perspectives, accepted at the 2020 ASEE-GSW conference: K. M. Nicklaus, D. Puperi, P. Clayton, “Perspectives on a Mentored Engineering Graduate Student Teaching Practicum for Faculty Teaching Preparation,” Proceedings of the 2020 ASEE Gulf-Southwest Annual Conference, April 2020.

<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
<p> <img src="teaching1.png" width="275" align='right' style="PADDING-LEFT: 30px">
A key responsibility for academics in higher education institutions is to impart knowledge and skills to undergraduate and graduate students. I have greatly enjoyed my teaching experiences and have endeavored to learn more about inclusive and effective instructional practices. Within biomedical research, I believe it is important for students to learn how to balance scientific principles and clinical need, how to engage with clinical partners in research, and how to identify skills and tools needed to address different healthcare problems. Providing active learning opportunities can allow students to struggle with questions that require including multiple viewpoints, seeking out experts and new skills, and communicating their results. My goal is to be an instructor that leads by example in both how to be a good forever-learner as well as in promoting inclusivity in the classroom and in life.   </p>


<h3 style="margin-top:80px"> Undergraduate Mentoring</h3>
<p>I have been fortunate to mentor 12 undergraduate students from various academic disciplines and programs. I have mentored students from the UT El Paso NIH BUILDing SCHOLARS program, UT Louis Stokes Academy for Minority Participation (LSAMP), Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering GLUE program sponsored by the UT Women in Engineering Program, UT BME NSF CuRES REU program, and the Livestrong Cancer Institute Summer Undergraduate Fellowship Research Program. Two students are now in medical school, one is in graduate school, and one works at Raytheon. Click on each student's pictures to view their poster presentations delivered at the BMES Annual Symposium and the UT Undergraduate Research Symposium.
