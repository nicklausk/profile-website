<p> New paper in press: Nicklaus, K.M., Bravo, K., Liu, C. et al. Undergarment needs after breast cancer surgery: a key survivorship consideration. Support Care Cancer (2020). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05414-z">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05414-z</a>

<p>Abstract: An important aspect of breast cancer survivorship is finding comfortable undergarments that work for women’s post-treatment bodies. Patients who undergo mastectomy, including both those who do and do not receive reconstruction, need bras that can accommodate new breast shape, size, and feel, as well as scarring and skin sensitivity. Our research with breast cancer patients and the literature reveal that ready-to-wear bras are inadequate for the variety of patients’ needs, and many women lack support and guidance to make decisions about undergarments after cancer. This commentary describes a major quality-of-life challenge for breast cancer survivors and makes recommendations for future research. Healthcare providers need more guidance and resources to be able to help their patients prepare for this aspect of survivorship. New technologies, such as biomechanical modeling, 3D body scanning, and manufacturing techniques, should be pursued in collaboration with patients, healthcare providers, and clothing designers to ease this burden for breast cancer patients.
